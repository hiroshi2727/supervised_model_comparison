# supervised_model_comparison
Compared the performance of 3 surpervised algorithms: SVM, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors.  
Used 3 datasets for performance evaluation. Extracted from UCI Machine Learing Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).  
The dataset I used: breast cancer, poker hand, wine quality.  
Used gridsearch method for 3 types of ratio of training and testing data: 20:80, 50:50, 80:20.  
Found the increase of performance as the number of training data increases.
